# Identity Chooser UI+ for Mozilla Thunderbird

This is a fork of Identity Chooser MX
[https://github.com/speedball2001/identitychooser-mx]
with some UI enhancements.
There are a number of purely visual changes.

One functional change is, you now have the option to choose
what happens when you simply close the Identity Chooser
Pop-Up.  The default is to close the Compose Window as
well. But now there is an option to just use the
default identity.

Also, on the Extension's Options Page, you can automatically
sort the Identities with specified criteria.

There is also a &quot;Use Default&quot; button
in addition to the &quot;Cancel&quot; button.

Do you remember the first time you accidentally sent a work related
email from your private email account? Identity Chooser helps you to
prevent that. It makes choosing the sender address explicit:

* Do you want to compose a new email? Identity Chooser forces you to
  choose the sender address first.

* Do you want to forward an email? Identity Chooser forces you to
  choose the sender address first.

To make it short: Every time you'll create a new message, Identity
Chooser shows you a menu with all your identities.

Everything in Identity Chooser is about making explicit choices. No
automatisms, no defaults.

And as a result you'll never send an email from the wrong email
address again.
